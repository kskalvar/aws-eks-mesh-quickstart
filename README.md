AWS App Mesh QuickStart  
===============================================
Abstract:
```
Although AWS EKS has been in GA for quite a while, and AWS EKS Fargate on the roadmap but not available yet,
it still requires a fair amount of manual effort to create the worker nodes and configure kubectl to talk to
the cluster.  In this QuickStart will build on CloudFormation scripts AWS has already provided to fully
automate the creation of the EKS Cluster.  We'll also use some basic shell scripts to configure kubectl on the  
EC2 Instance to talk to the cluster.
